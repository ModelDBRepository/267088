## This ModelDB page includes two models, in separate folders:

1. The __Hay-based__ model, which was built using the complete biophysics and morphology from [Hay et al. (2011)](https://modeldb.science/139653), with an added section of passive cable attached at the end of the AIS, and 

2. The __Hu-based__ model, which was built using the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, and K<sub>V</sub> channel models, and pyramidal cell morphology from [Hu et al. (2009)](https://modeldb.science/123897). 

* The simulations compute backpropagation and forwardpropagation (AP) thresholds with a range of AIS Na<sub>V</sub> distributions, from scratch, albeit slowly in the case of the Hu-based model (hours) and more rapidly in the Hay-based model.


### In the Hay-based model folder, the user can run the following simulations:

* `python backprop_somatic_stim.py`

    This script generates the data for Fig 7A.


* `python backprop_axonal_stim.py`

    This script generates the data for Fig 7B.


* `python BAP_figure_HayModel.py`

    This script generates space plots of backpropagation with axonal and somatic stimulation, just above and just below threshold. It should create four PDFs in total.
 


### The Hu-based model folder has four subfolders in which the user can run simulations:
(Inside a given folder, enter the corresponding command into the terminal.)

* *__backprop_threshold_somatic_stimulation__*:

    `python backprop_somatic_stim.py`

* *__backprop_threshold_axonal_stimulation__*:

    `python backprop_axonal_stim.py`

* *__reference_curve_somatic_stimulation__*:

    `python reference_curve_somatic.py`

* *__reference_curve_axonal_stimulation__*:

    `python reference_curve_axonal.py`


* Running the Hu-based model code will produce CSV files containing the threshold and various model settings, such as the NaV distribution parameters 'x' and 'ùúÖ' (called 'deviation' and 'CrossOverPosition', respectively, in the CSV files). 
To plot the data in files with names beginning "`sqlite3`...", they must first be processed into Python dictionaries using the script `database_to_dictionary.py`.
